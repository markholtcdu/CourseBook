<div>It takes a fraction of a second to send an email across the world.</div >
<div>“Latency” is the time it takes a message to be read by a human.</div >
<div>Before 1970 most computers were not networked.</div >
<div>Networks began so that people could share data and resources.</div >
<div>In the 1950s and 1960s computers were networked between buildings.</div >
<div>Sneakernet means someone walks data from one computer to another.</div >
<div>A Local Area Network (LAN) is always in the same room.</div >
<div>A LAN can be made up of thousands of computers.</div >
<div>ETHERNET is a technology for LAN</div >
<div>The address says what computer a message should be sent to.</div >
<div>Addresses are in the headers of data packets.</div >
<div>In an Ethernet every computer processes every packet of data sent.</div >
<div>Every computer has its own unique MAC code for internet or ethernet.</div >
<div>The carrier for wifi is the air.</div >
<div> CSMA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access) means only one computer can sense a carrier.</div >
<div>Bandwidth is the speed a carrier can send and receive data.</div >
<div>Exponential backoff means a computer will wait a decreasing amount of time before attempting to send a signal on a network.</div >
<div>It is not possible to own a dedicated network line.</div >
<div>A network switch means data is always sent to all parts of a network.</div >
<div>A route is the system of switches a message travels along on the internet.</div >
<div>The number of switches a message goes through is called the hop count.</div >
<div>Packet switching means a large message is cut into smaller packets and sent along the same route.</div >
<div>Every computer connected to the internet has an IP address.</div >
<div>An IP address is four eight digit numbers e.g. 172.217.7.238</div >
<div>The latest packet switching network is called the ARPANET.</div >
<div>ARPANET started with less than 50 computers.</div >
<div>There are more computers online than human beings in the world.</div >
